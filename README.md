# Emulation Template
Please note, this codebase is very new and somethings use my forks instead of the real repo. 

This repository contains code that @Emulation is coded on, and is a basic template for you to code your own discord bot in Python. 

There will be a handful of features missing, this is normal. I don't want people to know exactly our backend to help stop exploiting and misuse which means it might not work. I do ask if the user using this. 

Tech Stack:
- Firebase, currently in the middle of a switch from Firebase -> Self-hosted MongoDB
- Redis, for caching 
- interactions.py, the library that Emulation uses in Python
- Quart, for our webserver to manage roblox -> discord, discord -> roblox, and other services we might have
- Docker, for our Emulation deployment to our host

# Instructions 
This is coming soon with Production and Development deployments.
